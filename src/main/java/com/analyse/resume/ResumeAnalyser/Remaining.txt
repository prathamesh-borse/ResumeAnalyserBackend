// Remaining Task to be done:

1. Get the Job Description and get his resume and tell the user how much skills will match with job description keywords.

//    Integrate skills into the role analysis
//    Take your existing extractSkills + extractSkillsByFrequency methods.
//    Combine them â†’ userSkills set.
//    Example: ["Java", "Spring Boot", "SQL", "React", "Node.js"]

//    Compare user skills vs expected skills
//    For each role:
//    matchedSkills = intersection(userSkills, roleSkills)
//    missingSkills = roleSkills - userSkills
//    coverage = matchedSkills.size / roleSkills.size
